# Robust-adaptive-Beamforming
Interference-plus-noise reconstruction
This repository contains MATLAB code in Robust adaptive beamforming for interference-plus-noise matrix reconstruction. This code is for two papers: 
1) Covariance Matrix Reconstruction Based on Power Spectral Estimation and Uncertainty Region for Robust Adaptive Beamforming. https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2022.3232100
2) Maximum entropy-based interference-plus-noise covariance matrix reconstruction for robust adaptive beamforming. https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2020.2994527
 The first method is defined as IPN-PSEUR, and the second one is defined as MEPS.
