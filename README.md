# Robust-adaptive-Beamforming
Interference-plus-noise reconstruction
This repository contains MATLAB code in Robust adaptive beamforming for interference-plus-noise matrix reconstruction. This code is for two papers: 
1) Covariance Matrix Reconstruction Based on Power Spectral Estimation and Uncertainty Region for Robust Adaptive Beamforming.
2) Maximum entropy-based interference-plus-noise covariance matrix reconstruction for robust adaptive beamforming
 The first method is defined as IPN-PSEUR and the second one is defined as MEPS.
